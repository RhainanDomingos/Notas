# Notas App

A note management application built with **SwiftUI**. This project utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage notes and demonstrates screen navigation using the **`@Environment`** property wrapper.

---

### Features

* **Note Management:** Create, view, and edit notes, with data being managed using an object-oriented approach.
* **SwiftUI State Management:** Uses the **`@State`** and **`@Bindable`** property wrappers to handle view state and enable two-way data binding for a seamless user experience.
* **Navigation:** Implements screen flow and dismissal using the **`@Environment`** property wrapper and **`NavigationStack`**.
* **UI Layout:** The interface is structured using a combination of **`Form`**, **`Section`**, **`HStack`**, and a **`Toolbar`** for a clean and functional design.
